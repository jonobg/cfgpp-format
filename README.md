# CFG++ Format

## 🎯 **Another Configuration Format**

Yet another configuration format. We ran into some annoying problems with existing formats and built something that might be slightly less problematic. Has a working Python implementation and VS Code extension.

## 📊 **Current Status: Working**

✅ **Python Implementation** (245K+ lines - seems to work)  
✅ **VS Code Extension** published on Eclipse Open VSX Registry and VS Code Marketplace  
✅ **90/90 Tests Passing** - all functionality tested  
✅ **CI Pipeline Green** - builds and tests pass  
✅ **Some Users** - small but growing  

### **What's Actually There**
- **146K+ lines** Python parser (works for most cases)  
- **28K+ lines** formatter (makes things look consistent)  
- **21K+ lines** Language Server (IDE integration)  
- **50K+ lines** schema validation (catches common mistakes)

## 🔧 **Implementations**

| Language | Status | Performance | Use Case | Location |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Python** | ✅ Working | Reasonable | General use, tooling | [`implementations/python/`](implementations/python/) |
| **Rust** | 🔄 In progress | Probably faster | If you need speed | [`implementations/rust/`](implementations/rust/) |
| **C++ LabVIEW** | 🔄 Planned | Unknown | LabVIEW integration | [`implementations/cpp-labview/`](implementations/cpp-labview/) |

---

## 🔧 **What It Does**

- **Readable syntax**: Configuration files that don't make you cry
- **Schema validation**: Catches mistakes before they cause problems  
- **Environment variables**: `${VAR:-default}` syntax that works
- **Include files**: Split large configs into manageable pieces with `@include`
- **Type checking**: Enums and types to prevent common errors
- **Comments**: You can actually document your configuration
- **Decent performance**: Fast enough for most use cases
- **VS Code support**: Syntax highlighting, completion, error checking

## 🔬 **Experimental Features (Maybe Useful)**

*Some ideas we're exploring - most probably won't work*

### **🤔 What We're Thinking About**
We're experimenting with making configuration files more useful for AI systems. Might be overkill for most use cases, but could be interesting for large deployments.

### **🧪 Experimental Ideas (Probably Overkill)**

#### **Things We're Prototyping**
- **Tree parsing**: O(1) section lookup (if you need that)
- **Hash validation**: Integrity checking (probably overkill for most configs)  
- **Compression**: LZ4/ZSTD integration (might help with large files)
- **Better validation**: Catch more mistakes before deployment

#### **Speculative Research**
- **AI reasoning modes**: Different ways to parse configs (5 levels of complexity)
- **AI-to-AI protocols**: Configuration exchange between systems (very experimental)
- **Automation features**: Generate deployment scripts from configs (might work)

#### **Far Future Ideas (Don't Hold Your Breath)**
- **Multi-AI coordination**: Configuration-driven AI orchestration  
- **Knowledge graphs**: Complex configuration relationships
- **Enterprise scale**: Multi-system consistency (if anyone needs this)

## 📖 **Quick Example**

```cfgpp
database {
    host = ${DATABASE_HOST:-"localhost"};
    port = 5432;
    ssl = true;
    
    connection_pool {
        min_connections = 5;
        max_connections = 20;
    }
}

servers = ["web1", "web2", "web3"];
log_level = DEBUG;
```

### **Future AI-Aware Example**
```cfgpp
@config-hash: "sha256:7f4e1a2b8c9d3e6f..."
@ai-validated-by: "deployment-ai"
@compression-config { algorithm = "lz4", target = "ai-communication" }

EnterpriseConfig::production(
    DatabaseConfig database = DatabaseConfig(
        string host = "${DB_HOST:-localhost}",
        ConnectionPool pool = ConnectionPool(
            int min-connections = 5,
            int max-connections = 50
        )
    ),
    
    SecurityConfig security = SecurityConfig(
        JWT jwt = JWT(
            string secret = "${JWT_SECRET}",
            int expiry-minutes = 15
        )
    )
)
```

pip install -e .

# Test if it works
python -c "from cfgpp.parser import loads; print('✅ CFGPP loaded')"
```

### **Development & Testing**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cfgpp-format.git
cd cfgpp-format

# Run comprehensive test suite

## 🛠️ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Zero-Risk Development Approach**
Based on proven methodology that took us from 191 errors → 0 errors → production ready:

1. **🏗️ Foundation Phase** - Feature flags with all AI features disabled by default
2. **🔄 Incremental Rollout** - Enable one feature at a time with extensive testing  
3. **🛡️ Safety Nets** - Immediate rollback capability and performance monitoring
4. **✅ Quality Gates** - Zero tolerance for breaking changes or test failures

### **Contributing to AI Features**
- **Phase 1 Contributors**: Hierarchical parsing and hash validation
- **Phase 2 Contributors**: AI reasoning modes and query interfaces  
- **Phase 3 Contributors**: Inter-AI communication protocols
- **Enterprise Partners**: Production deployment automation use cases

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Quality Assurance**

### **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
```bash
# Full test suite (90/90 passing)
cd implementations/python
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=cfgpp

# Performance benchmarks
python -m pytest tests/test_performance.py -v

# Integration tests with VS Code extension
cd vscode-extension
npm test
```

### **Zero Tolerance Quality Standards**
- ✅ **No failing tests** - Fix root causes, don't skip
- ✅ **No CI failures** - Red X's indicate user-facing problems  
- ✅ **No syntax errors in examples** - Users copy/paste these
- ✅ **Professional appearance** - Clean repository with proper artifact management
