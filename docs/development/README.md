# Development Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the development process, analysis, and meta-information about the CFGPP-Format project.

## Contents

- **[CRITICAL_ISSUES_RESOLVED.md](CRITICAL_ISSUES_RESOLVED.md)** - Summary of critical documentation issues and their resolution

## Historical Context

These documents record the journey of discovering that CFGPP-Format was a "hidden gem with catastrophic documentation problems" rather than a failed technical project. The analysis and resolution process established new standards for documentation quality and verification methodologies.

## For Future Development

When making changes to syntax or core features:
1. Update the authoritative syntax reference first
2. Test changes against the actual parser implementation  
3. Verify all documentation examples still work
4. Follow the professional documentation standards established during this resolution
